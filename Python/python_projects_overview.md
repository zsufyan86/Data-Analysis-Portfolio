### Python Projects

#### App Ratings Prediction

- **Code**: [App Ratings Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Python%20-%20Projects/App%20Ratings%20Prediction.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To build a model to predict the app rating based on various features provided in the Google Play Store dataset.
- **Description**: The project involves thorough data analysis and preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for model building. It includes handling null values, correcting data types, performing outlier treatment, and conducting univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable (app rating). The project also includes feature engineering, such as creating dummy variables for categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Finally, a linear regression model is built to predict app ratings, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the R2 score.
- **Skills**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, linear regression, model evaluation.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Results**: The linear regression model achieved an R2 score of 0.1346 on the test set and 0.1946 on the train set. This indicates that the model explains 13.46% of the variance in the test data and 19.46% in the train data.

#### Insurance Data Analysis

- **Code**: [Insurance Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Python%20-%20Projects/Insurance%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To analyze the insurance dataset and create a model to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various input features.
- **Description**: An insurance agency, ABC Insurance, wants to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on their dataset containing information about policyholders and claims to gain insights for better business decisions.
- **Skills**: Data analysis, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data visualization, Feature engineering, Machine learning modeling.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Results**: Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project successfully analyzed the insurance dataset. Key findings included the relationship between age, BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges. A machine learning model was built to predict insurance charges based on input features.
